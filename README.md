# PPBP - Network traffic generator - ns3

This tool is based on the Poisson Pareto Burst Process (PPBP), a Long-Range Dependent (LRD) model for network traffic. The PPBP model provides a simple and accurate network traffic generator that matches statistical properties of real-life IP net- works. We have implemented this model in the network simulator ns3.
